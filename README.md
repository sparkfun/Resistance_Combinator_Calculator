Resistance Combinator and Calculator - Python 3 Script
===================================

This script calculates the resistance of combinations of resistors. For the time
being the resistors have to be hardcoded into the script by replacing the
values in the resistor array "resistorArr". Make sure the values are in Ohms
and that you leave at least five values in the array. When you call the python
script from the command prompt every combination of resistor and their combined
resistance will be printed to the screen.
