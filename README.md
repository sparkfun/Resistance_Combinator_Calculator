Resistance Combinator and Calculator Python 3 Script
===================================

This script calculates the resistance of combinations of given resistors. For the time
being the resistors have to be hardcoded into the resistor array. It's quite
simple, just replace the resistor values in Ohms in the resistor array with
your values and call the python script from the command prompt. Every
combination of resistor will be determined (sets of twos, threes, up to fives)
and the values will be printed to the command prompt.
